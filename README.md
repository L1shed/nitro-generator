there is a very low chance of this successfully getting you nitro for free. i made this project to have more time with Kotlin/JVM and kill time.

### How to build the project

### Things we need assistance from contributors
- ❌ SVG icons beside the label of tabs like in Maple Lite.
- ❌ Maple-like ComboBox pop up.
- ❌ Replace CheckBox with a Maple-like toggle switch element.
- ❌ Add Maple-like value slider beside the text field. (See [ElementValue.kt](https://github.com/SpoilerRules/nitro-generator/blob/borderpane-ver/src/main/kotlin/com/spoiligaming/generator/gui/element/ElementValue.kt))
